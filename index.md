Hi! I'm Richard Demsyn-Jones. <img class="profile-picture" src="assets/img/headshot_b.jpeg"> I work at Thumbtack, where I manage data scientists and engineers in
our Marketplace and ML Infra teams.

I recently started a technical blog, [*Simplicity is SOTA*](https://simplicityissota.substack.com), on machine learning, engineering, and marketplaces. Check it out!

I am an avid reader of books, papers, articles, newspapers, newsletters â€” anything, really. See
the list below for some of the topics I like to read about. I'm
always excited to find intellectually curious folks, to share ideas with or collaborate. 
Don't be shy about reaching out if you would like to talk or I could be of some help to you.
